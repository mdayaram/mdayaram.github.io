So I got a Sketch Doodle kit from Yvonne which comes with a bunch of sketch doodle ideas.  The first one was “Aardvark.”  They show you the picture of a very cartoony aardvark and then have instructions on how you can draw it.  I really liked the inspiration since one of my biggest problems is just thinking of things to draw, but I didn’t like the instruction set on how to draw an aardvark, so I just went ahead and drew one from random pictures I found on the internet of real aardvarks.

I’m not too much of a fan on how it came out.  I finished drawing him and was disappointed.  Molly suggested I draw him play cards, so I gave him a hand of cards.  Then I thought it looked somewhat boring so I added a rabbit eating his cards, and the rabbit made me think of Alice in Wonderland and pocket watches, so I draw that with a secret Ace.

Overall a very random sketch.
