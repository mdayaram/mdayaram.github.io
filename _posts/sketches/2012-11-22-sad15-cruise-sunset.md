We saw this beautiful sunset on the cruise, the horizon was flooded with really thick gray clouds, and you could barely see the sun just below it, on the horizon line, and slightly above. Â The clouds had a sharp stop, leading up to a really gorgeous gradient sky.

My depiction is pretty terrible unfortunately.
