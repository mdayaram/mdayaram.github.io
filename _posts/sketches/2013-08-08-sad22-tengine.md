My company came up with this new marketing term called a t.Engine.  The current logo is still a work in progress, but there was a joking consensus that it looked like a meat grinder.  Ike, the marketer who came up with the logo, challenged us to do better.

Thus, I present to you my rendition of a t.Engine!  In traditional start-up napkin canvas =D
