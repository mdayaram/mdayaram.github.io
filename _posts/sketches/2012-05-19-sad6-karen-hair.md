Well, you can tell you fail at life when you get a sketch-a-day notebook, decide that’s too hard so you relax the condition to sketch-a-week, and *still* can’t get that going….

Anyways, this one is a quick sketch I did of Karen while we were driving to/from/during Monterey.  I used my rainbow color pencil which is why all the colors are kind of blending with each other.
