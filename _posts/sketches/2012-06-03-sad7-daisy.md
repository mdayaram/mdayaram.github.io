This is Daisy, one of Molly and Larry’s bearded dragons.  I started drawing her while she was laying on the log as depicted here, but then the bigger bearded dragon, Derek, pushed her off before I could finish my sketch, so I kind of improvised most of her body’s lower half.  Oh well, didn’t turn out terribly I suppose.
