I’m not sure what I was doing here.  I started off with a giant ball, and thought it would be funny to draw a dinosaur on it, so it was like, a dinosaur riding an asteroid, reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove.

But then I drew some guys playing ping pong with it, and…some crazy dude in the corner, I don’t know.  First experiment in mental drawing.
