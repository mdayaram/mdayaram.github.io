Me and Molly have been wanting to put up some paintings on our walls, so I recently bought a watercolor set and we started some practice paintings.  I drew/painted this jelly fish.  Could be better, but it’s a nice start.  Helped me learn a decent amount on how to control watercolor stuff.  Note to self, never try to color white on top of another color.
