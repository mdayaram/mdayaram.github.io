I’m starting a sketch-a-day journal.  It’s only been like four days and I already fell off the bandwagon with only two sketches, which is fine.  As long as I can go at least a sketch a week, I feel accomplished.
I drew this while I was bumming around in Central Park.  I looked around for things to draw and was feeling pretty meh about everything, so I started digging through the pictures on my phone and found this pic of James at Starbucks, and the rest is terrible drawing history.
