> The Journey is over! Thanks everyone who housed me during the project and facilitated me living out one of the best years of my life! Leaving this page here for posterity.

Hi friends! As some of you may already know, I have been embarking on a vagabond journey! On June 2018, I moved out of place to couch surf. But instead of couch surfing with strangers, I thought it would be neat if I could couch surf with my friends!

* Have you ever wanted to spend more time with me? No?
* Are you going on a trip and need someone to take care of your house/cat/dog/fluffy? No?
* Do you pity me and want to lend me a hand? ...

> Yes! Please come live with me! Where do I sign up!?

Yay! Thanks so much for considering to house me.  You probably have a lot of questions, and I am here to hopefully provide answers.  Let me know if you have questions that are not answered and I'll add them in!

# FAQ

## But...why?

I find this exciting! It's my way to get a sneak peek at what it's like to live in several different places.  Can I handle the commute from Oakland? Can I deal with being a remote employee in Colorado? I don't have answers to these yet, but hopefully I will soon!  In addition to that, I'm excited to catch up with my friends. In my life, the only people I see more than once a month are my roommates and my coworkers.  So if we can't work together, let's live together for a week!

## Is this a vacation?

No!  I will still be working at Square full time during this.  If your home is in the Bay Area, I will be commuting to the SF office.  If your home is in NYC, I will be commuting to the NYC office.  If your home does not have a Square office nearby, I will be working remotely either from your home or a cafe.  I do not like vacations >.>

## We have a dog/cat/fluffy, aren't you allergic?

Yes, but I choose not to be ruled by my allergies, but rather, be ruled by my love for dogs/cats/fluffies.  I also always carry allergy medicine with me.  For the record, I grew up with a dog I loved but was deathly allergic to for 7 years.  I would *love* to stay with you and your fluffies.

## Night or morning showerer?

I normally shower in the morning, but I am more than happy to change my habits to fit your schedule.

## What are your expectations?

I’m pretty low-key.  I’m happy to join you in your morning and evening routine, or do my own thing.  I don’t expect to hangout more than the time we see each other at home, though happy to spend more time together if you’d like.  At the end of the day, I’m driving this as a pretty low-commitment thing.

## Am I going to have to feed you too?

Nope! I will fend for myself unless you'd prefer otherwise.  If possible, I would love to treat *you and your roommates/family* to a fancy dinner as a thank you for letting me stay with you.

## We don't have an extra bed, just a couch!

Totally fine!  I've actually been sleeping on the floor for the past two years now, and have slept on a couch nearly all of highschool and on the floor all of college.  I did sleep on a bed for the last month, and I guess I _kinda_ understand what all the fuss is about, but yeah, couches and floors are great.

## How long would you stay?

A maximum of two weeks!  This is both for your sanity and mine.  I want to err in the side of caution and prevent a potential “overstaying” scenario.  My goal is to strengthen my relationships, not deteriorate them >.>


That's all I got so far! Thanks again! Looking forward to hopefully crashing on your couch!
