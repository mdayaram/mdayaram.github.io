Hi friends! As some of you may already know, I have been embarking on a vagabond journey! On June 2018, I moved out of place to couchsurf. But instead of couch surfing with strangers, I thought it would be neat if I could couch surf with my friends!

* Have you ever wanted to spend more time with me? No?
* Are you going on a trip and need someone to take care of your house/cat/dog/fluffy? No?
* Do you pity me and want to lend me a hand? ...

If any of those answers were yes, then please fill out the following form!

[Yes! Please come live with me! Where do I sign up!?](https://goo.gl/forms/e2mroPL5NQAQzXBr2)

I know you may have lots of questions! Thus, I have made [this handy dandy FAQ](/journey/faq) to hopefully answer them. Let me know if there's anything you think I should add!

Thanks! Looking forward to hopefully crashing on your couch!
