Today was the first day of Outside Lands.  Between all the stages, there was this one section in the middle of the woods called “Digital Detox: Disconnect to Reconnect.”  It was basically an area where they kindly asked you to turn off your phones and had a bunch of really cool old retro type of stuff.

There were rotary phones, chalkboards, crayons, board games, tea rooms…and a typewriter.  I’ve had “[We Belong](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxZInIyOBXk)" stuck in my head recently, so I typed up a lyric from it on the top of an index card.  I then promptly folded it up and kept it in my wallet.

When I got home I found the card again while clearing out my pockets.  After looking at it for a while, I just couldn’t help the urge to illustrate it.  I actually spent quite a bit of time on this one, but I love how it turned out.  It’s probably one of my favorites.
