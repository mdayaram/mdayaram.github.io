		Hello there, welcome to my site!  My name is Manoj Dayaram,
		and I'm probably #{currently_doing?} right now.

		If you came here to find out what I like, well then, I like fruit
		parfaits, [hugs](/hugs.html), tea, pocket watches, puppies, kittens,
		[ponies](http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic_Wiki),
		top hats, monocles, half-belts, gloves, alpacas, and
		[drawing](http://blog.noj.cc/tagged/sketch).  I would also like doing
		handstands if I could do them *shakes fist* and I would also like to
		travel more.

.section

		I will occasionally write [random musings](http://blog.noj.cc) about life
		and such whenever I get the time or have a good idea.  It's mostly brain
		dump for me, but perhaps it is of interest to you.

.section
	:markdown
		Unfortunately, there's not much else here, but if you'd like to find out
		more about me, you can always get in touch with me through other channels.

		Still looking for more? Well, here's a picture of Beowulf ripping
		Grendel's arm off.
